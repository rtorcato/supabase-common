# Changesets

This repo uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for
versioning and publishing its packages (`packages/*`).

When you make a change that should be released, add a changeset:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Pick the affected package(s) and bump type (patch/minor/major) and write a short
summary. The changeset file is committed with your PR. On merge to `main`, the
release workflow opens a "Version Packages" PR; merging that publishes the
changed packages to npm (with provenance).
